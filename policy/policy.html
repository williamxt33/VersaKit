                <p><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong></p>

                </ul>

                <h3>3. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    VersaKit may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance user experience. These may include:

                <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>
                    Some tools may use third-party services (such as currency exchange APIs). When using these tools, you may be subject to the third party's privacy policy. We recommend reviewing their policies.

                <p>
                    Since most processing happens locally in your browser, we do not retain your input data. Analytics data may be retained for a reasonable period to improve our services.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
